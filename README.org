* Basic Packstack environment

This =Vagrantfile= is suitable to test Packstack deployment of
Openstack Kilo on two nodes:
 - one controller;
 - one compute.

** Requirements

   The requirements are:
   - =bundler <1.8.0 >1.3=
   - =libvirtd= with =kvm/qemu= backend

** Installation

   #+begin_src shell
     gem install bundle -v '<1.8.0'
     bundle install
     bundle exec vagrant up

   #+end_src

   If you have nested KVM activated, then it automatically takes
   advantage of it.

** Helpers

   There is a very simple script, =provisioner.sh= which:
   1. install the repositories for a working CentOS7 Packstack
      installation
   2. add the IP to the new interfaces.
   
   If no IPv4 traffic, is going to and from some interface check those
   =sysctl= on the hypervisor.  They are all displayed after the
   =vagrant up= run.  One nasty one is
   =/proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-ip6tables= which can block
   IPv6 traffic.  Check the message at the end of the run.
